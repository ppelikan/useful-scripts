# Meld Caja
Integrates Caja (MATE Desktop) and Meld tool. Should also work for Nautilus and other similar file managers.

Just copy those two scripts into `/home/USERNAME/.config/caja/scripts/`
Then right click on first file you wand to compare and under `Scripts` select `Meld_Compare_Left`. When you will select the second file for comparision click on `Meld_Compare_Right` and the Meld tool will open showing both files compared.
